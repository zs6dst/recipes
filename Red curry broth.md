# Red curry broth with rice noodles
A Thai style broth

## Ingredients (for 2 portions)
- 200-300g skinless chicken pieces (breast or thigh), cut into small bite sized chunks
- 1/2 red capsicum, small dice
- 1/2 onion, small dice
- spring onions, cut in smallish pieces, to taste
- 1-2 garlick cloves, to taste
- grated fresh ginger, to taste
- 1-2 tablespoons Thai red curry paste, to taste
- 1000ml chicken stock
- 1 can coconut cream, or coconut milk (I prefer cream)
- rice noodles (sufficient for 2 portions)
- fish sauce (about 1 tablespoon)
- brown sugar (about 2 teaspoons)
- chopped coriander
- lemon/lime juice

## Method
1.	Marinade chicken pieces in corn flour, a splash of soy sauce and salt for about 15-30 minutes

2.	Stir fry chicken with salt & pepper to taste. Remove and keep aside.

3.	Stir fry curry paste for a few seconds, then add onion, capsicum, garlick, ginger. Fry to combine flavour, not to soften veg too much.

4.	Add stock and coconut cream/milk. Bring to boil, then on low heat for a few minutes.

5.	Add chicken, cook for about 10 minutes.

6.	Add (dry) noodles, then fish sauce and sugar to taste. Cook until noodles are soft to taste - about 5 minutes.

7.	Add lemon/lime juice and adjust to taste with more fish sauce and/or sugar.

8.	Garnish each portion with chopped coriander and thinly sliced spring onion. I like a lot!
