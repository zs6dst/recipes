# Cafe de Paris butter
A flavoured butter best served with a perfectly cooked steak.

## Ingredients
- 500g softened unsalted butter
- 30g tomato sauce
- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
- 1 tablespoon washed baby capers
- 3 eschalots, coarsely chopped
- 1 bunch flat-leaf parsley, picked and roughly chopped
- 1 bunch chives coarsely chopped
- 1 teaspoon chopped dill sprigs
- ½ teaspoon marjoram, dried
- pinch dried rosemary, chopped
- 1 clove garlic
- 4 anchovy fillets
- 1 tablespoon brandy
- 1 tablespoon Madeira or Malmsey
- ½ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
- ½ teaspoon sweet paprika
- ½ teaspoon mild curry powder
- ½ teaspoon crushed black peppercorns
- zest of ½ lemon
- zest of ½ orange
- juice of 1 lemon
- 1 teaspoon sea salt

## Method

1. Remove butter from refrigerator 30 minutes before using. Beat butter until very soft and aerated. The butter will become almost white at this stage. Combine all remaining ingredients (except the butter) in food processor and process until well pureed.

2. Fold puree into the beaten butter.

3. Form the butter into a log on glad wrap or baking paper, shape and freeze until required.

4. To serve, grill or barbecue rump steak until cooked as desired; stand, covered 5 minutes to rest. Cut 1cm slices off butter logs and place on cooked steak.

5. If desired you can grill the butter-topped steak to lightly brown the top and/or finish melting the butter. You could also use a blow-torch if one is available.

6. Serve immediately.
